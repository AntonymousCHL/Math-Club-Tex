\subsubsection{Inclusion-Exclusion Principle}
Two sets: $|A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1\cap A_2|$.\\
Three sets: $|A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| -|A_1\cap A_2| - |A_2\cap A_3| - |A_3\cap A_1| +|A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3|$.\\

\section{Probability}

\subsection{Definition}
The probability of an event is a number that indicates how likely the event is to occur.\\
Mathematical Definition:$$P(A)=\frac{\text{Number of times A happens}}{\text{Sample Space}}$$

\subsubsection{Discrete}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example 1: A pair of dice are rolled, what is the probability of getting a sum of 7? \vspace{40px}
    \item Example 2: 6 coins are tossed, what is the probability of getting a 2 head?
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak

\subsubsection{Continuous}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example 1: Point A is chosen randomly in $[0,2]\times[0,2]$, what's the probability that OA is less than 1.?\vspace{40px}
    \item Example 2: 2 points are chosen randomly in [0,1], what's the probability that their distance is less than 0.5.  \vspace{40px}
    \item Example 3: Point A is chosen randomly in $[0,1]$, what's the probability that A is 0.25.?\vspace{40px}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Some Formulae about Probability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  $P(E \cap F)=P(E)P(F)$ if E and F are independent events.
    \item  $P(E \cup F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E \cap F)$.
    \item  $P(E|F)	=	\frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example}
What's the probability of tossing 3 heads in a row?
\vspace{30px}
\subsubsection{Example}
A pair of dice are rolled, what is the probability of getting a sum of 7 given that one of them is 6?
\vspace{30px}
\subsubsection{Example}
An integer is randomly chosen in [1,100],  what is the probability that it is a multiple of 2 or 5?
\vspace{30px}
\pagebreak
\subsection{Expected Value}
$$E = \sum \text{outcome}\times P(\text{outcome})$$
\subsubsection{Example}
A local club plans to invest \$10000 to host a baseball game. They expect to sell tickets worth \$15000 . But if it rains on the day of game, they won't sell any tickets and the club will lose all the money invested. If the weather forecast for the day of game is 20\% possibility of rain, is this a good investment?
\vspace{50px}
\subsubsection{Example}
If Adam rolls a die repeatedly until he obtains a 6, what is the anticipated number of times he will need to roll the die?
