\subsubsection{Inclusion-Exclusion Principle}
Two sets: $|A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1\cap A_2|$.\\
Three sets: $|A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| -|A_1\cap A_2| - |A_2\cap A_3| - |A_3\cap A_1| +|A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3|$.\\
\\
Example:\\
There are $20$ students participating in an after-school program offering classes in yoga, bridge, and painting. Each student must take at least one of these three classes, but may take two or all three. There are $10$ students taking yoga, $13$ taking bridge, and $9$ taking painting. There are $9$ students taking at least two classes. How many students are taking all three classes?
