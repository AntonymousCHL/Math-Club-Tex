\subsection{Ptolemy's theorem}

If a quadrilateral is inscribable in a circle then the product of the lengths of its diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the lengths of the pairs of opposite sides.
\\Or ab+cd=xy where a,b,c,d are the sides of the quadrilateral and x,y are the diagonals.

\subsection{Problem}
In \(\triangle\)ABC, point D is inside of ABC such that \(\angle DAC = \angle DCA=30^{\circ} \) and \(\angle DBA=60^{\circ}\). E is the midpoint on BC and F is a trisect point on AC such that \(CF = \frac{CA}{3} \). Prove DE \(\perp\) EF.
